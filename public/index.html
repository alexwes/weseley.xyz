        Hi! I'm Alex. In May 2023 I graduated from Cornell University with a B.S. in Information Science from the Ann S. Bowers College of Computing and Information Science. My major concentration was data science where I deeply honed my analytical skills. I also did the Business for Engineers minor. Some of my favorite classes from undergrad include 'Intro to Computer Networks', 'Data Analytics (ML/AI)', and 'Magical Mushroom and Mischievous Molds'. 
        </br>
        </br>
        In my time at Cornell I was greatly involved in Cornell Blockchain - the premier blockchain student organization on campus. I began as an Analyst on the Research and Development team where I did research on various protocols - most notably this is where I first learned about Uniswap and AMMs, a topic I gave a presentation on at the end of the semester. I would go on to head the club's marketing efforts which involved primarily managing our social media accounts, getting the word out about the club to attract the campus' best talent, and to promote our annual <a href="https://www.cornellblockchain.org/#conferences">Cornell Blockchain Conference</a>. Following a club reorganization, in my last semester I would lead as the Head of Research, overseeing the Consulting, Goverance, and Technical Research teams. Here I assisted in researching the decentralized storage market, blockchain business models, and sat in on meetings where students way smarter than myself discussed how to implement onchain dark pools.

        I lived the first twelve years of my life in beautiful Buenos Aires, where I now visit yearly to see friends and family. These days I live in Manhattan.
